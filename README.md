# Example code for IDD Lite Dataset (http://idd.insaan.iiit.ac.in/dataset/download/)
This code is for helping newcomers understand semantic segmentation and the IDD Lite dataset. For using:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Please register, download and extract the IDD Lite dataset to a folder "idd20k_lite" in the same directory.
3. Run viewer.py to view the annotations overlaid on top of the corresponding image.
4. Run main.py to train a simple semantic segmentation model on the dataset.
5. [Comming Soon] Generate images for the test dataset to be uploaded to the leaderboard at: http://idd.insaan.iiit.ac.in/evaluation/submissions/
